# PRISM- Privacy-preserving Inference System with Homomorphic Encryption and Modular Activation
 
With the rapid advancements in machine learning, models have become increasingly capable of learning and making predictions in various industries. However, deploying these models in critical infrastructures presents a major challenge, as concerns about data privacy prevent unrestricted data sharing. Homomorphic encryption (HE) offers a solution by enabling computations on encrypted data, but it remains incompatible with machine learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), due to their reliance on non-linear activation functions. To bridge this gap, this work proposes an optimized framework that replaces standard non-linear functions with homomorphically compatible approximations, ensuring secure computations while minimizing computational overhead. The proposed approach restructures the CNN architecture and introduces an efficient activation function approximation method to mitigate the performance trade-offs introduced by encryption. Experimental results using the CIFAR-10 dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with an accuracy of 94.4\% with 2.4s per inference, demonstrating its ability to preserve accuracy while significantly reducing computational complexity in encrypted environments.
